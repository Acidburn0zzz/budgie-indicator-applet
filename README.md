AppIndicator applet for budgie-desktop


TODO
-----

 - [ ] Fix menu theming for Raven System Theme (currently can only use without system theme)
 - [ ] Change menu displays to popups - probably will fix the above

Enhancements
-----

 - [ ] For the applet settings add capability to change indicator order
 - [ ] If using system tray in conjunction then should hide appindicator network manager applet
 - [ ] Appindicator spacing is too wide
 - [ ] Applet background needs to use panel colour 
 - [ ] Applet background needs to respect raven stylise regions option
